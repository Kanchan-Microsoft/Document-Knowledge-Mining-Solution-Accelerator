## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture
The solution follows a microservices architecture deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service:

1. **Ingress Layer**: Azure Application Gateway for load balancing
2. **Web Application**: React-based UI served from Azure App Service
3. **API Services**: 
   - Document Processor Service (handles file processing)
   - AI Service (orchestrates LLM interactions)
4. **Storage Layer**: Blob Storage for documents, Cosmos DB for metadata
5. **Search Layer**: Azure AI Search with vectorized indexing
6. **AI Layer**: Azure OpenAI for chat and processing, Document Intelligence for OCR

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Documents uploaded to blob storage
2. **Extraction**: Text and context extraction using OCR and LLM
3. **Summarization**: AI-generated summaries of content
4. **Entity Extraction**: Keywords and entities identified
5. **Chunking**: Content split into manageable chunks
6. **Vectorization**: Embeddings created for semantic search
7. **Indexing**: Results stored in Azure AI Search

## Key Components

### Backend API (`App/backend-api/`)
- **KernelMemory Integration**: Manages document import, processing, and querying
- **Document Repository**: Handles document metadata and storage operations
- **Chat Host**: Orchestrates conversational AI interactions
- **Data Cache Management**: Optimizes performance with caching strategies

### Frontend Application (`App/frontend-app/`)
- **React/TypeScript SPA**: Modern web application with responsive design
- **Document Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop file upload with progress tracking
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational AI for document querying
- **Search and Filtering**: Advanced document discovery capabilities

### Kernel Memory Service (`App/kernel-memory/`)
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Manages document processing workflows
- **Handler System**: Pluggable handlers for different processing steps
- **Web Service**: RESTful API for document operations
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous document pipeline execution

## Deployment and Infrastructure
